# Building OCI images with `apko` and GitHub actions

This repository demonstrates the `chainguard-dev/actions/apko-build` action.
See the [`.apko.yaml`](.apko.yaml) and [.github/workflows/release.yaml](.github/workflows/release.yaml)
files for more information as to how this all fits together.

If you run `docker run -it ghcr.io/kaniini/apko-test:v0.1.2` for example,
you will be able to run an image generated by this workflow.
